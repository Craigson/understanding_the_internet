TCP is one of the main protocols belonging to the Internet Protocol Suite.  It has its origins in the early network implementation in which it was complimented by the Internet Protoco ( IP ). For this reason, the entire suite is often referred to as TCP/IP.  TCP forms part of the Transport Layer of the Internet Protocol Suite.  The Transport Layer lives below the Application Layer and above the Internet Layer.

TCP provides more reliable, ordered and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating over an IP network.  Internet applications such as the World Wide Web, e-mail, remote access, SSH, and file transfer are all dependent on TCP.  TCP prioritizes reliability, as opposed to UDP which prioritizes reduced latency.

TCP is a standardized protocol which means individual applications don't have to have knowledge of the mechanisms used for sending data via a link - for example how the data is split into packets. TCP handles all the particulars relating to handshaking and transmission and offers the application an abstraction of the connection.

During transportation of data, IP packets can get lost, duplicated or delivered in the wrong order.  TCP detects these problems and either requests the packets be resent, or rearranges them if they're received in the wrong order.  If certain packets don't reach their destination, the source becomes aware of this fact, and resends the packets.  Once the TCP receiver has reassembled the collection of packets in the correct order, the data is passed to the receiving application.

<p>
TCP is a reliable stream delivery service which guarantees that all bytes received will be identical with bytes sent and in the correct order. Since packet transfer by many networks is not reliable, a technique known as 'positive acknowledgement with re-transmission' is used to guarantee reliability. This fundamental technique requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgement message as it receives the data. The sender keeps a record of each packet it sends and maintains a timer from when the packet was sent. The sender re-transmits a packet if the timer expires before receiving the message acknowledgement. The timer is needed in case a packet gets lost or corrupted.

<p>
<b>An important distinction to note is that IP handles the delivery of data, while TCP keeps track of the 'segments', or packets, that the data is divided into. For example, when an HTML file is sent from a web server, the TCP software layer of that server divides the sequence of file octets into segments and forwards them individually to the IP software layer (Internet Layer). The Internet Layer encapsulates each TCP segment into an IP packet by adding a header that includes (among other data) the destination IP address. When the client program on the destination computer receives them, the TCP layer (Transport Layer) re-assembles the individual segments and ensures they are correctly ordered and error-free as it streams them to an application.</b>

The TCP window prevents a fast sender from overwhelming a slow
consumer application.
