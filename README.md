# understanding_the_internet

### The existence of this repo serves 3 purposes:
1) To help me better understand the internet by researching one topic a day,
and writing about it here,
2) That the documentation of this process may help others in the future, and
3) To improve my front-end web dev skills by implementing my own features for navigating the site.
