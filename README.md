# understanding_the_internet

This site is inspired by the '100 days of making' class at NYU's ITP grad progam. It serves as documentation and a point of reference for my own attempt at further understanding how the internet works. Every day, for one hundred days, I'll be identifying an idea, term or topic that I've encountered along the way, researching it, and doing my best to explain it in (mostly) my own words. My hope is that in the process of bolstering my own understanding, and creating a glossary of sorts, it might be of use to someone else in the future.

### The existence of this repo serves 3 purposes:

- 1) To help me better understand the internet by researching one topic a day,
and writing about it here,
- 2) That the documentation of this process may help others in the future, and
- 3) To improve my front-end web dev skills by implementing my own features for navigating the site.
